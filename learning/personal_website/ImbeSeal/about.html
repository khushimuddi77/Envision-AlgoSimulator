              in S9, ECE batch-1 at NITK.<br>I have quite a few 
              interests which I sometimes indulge in. Valorant, 
              Basketball, general coding are fun to perform.<br>
              Machine Learning and Artificial Engineering is one 
              interesting topic I came across recently. The idea
              of something non-living being able to think or form 
              neural networks like living organisms do (Humans 
              specifically) giving rise to logic and thought is 
              fascinating.<br><br><br></p>
